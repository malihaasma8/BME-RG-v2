# Biomedical Engineering Research Group — Website Starter

This is a simple, clean starter you can customize. It includes:
- `index.html` — homepage with hero, highlights, news, and contact
- `mission.html` — mission, vision, objectives
- `subgroups.html` — grid of research subgroups
- `style.css`, `script.js`, and a simple SVG logo

## Quick Edit
Open the HTML files with any editor (VS Code, Notepad, etc.) and replace bracketed placeholders `[...]` with your real content.

## Publish (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public): **biomed-site** (any name is fine).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo root.
3. In the repo, open **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**, pick **main** and `/ (root)`, save.
5. Wait 1–2 minutes, your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
6. To update, edit files and push changes — the site updates automatically.

## Custom Domain (Optional)
- Buy a domain (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy).
- In GitHub Pages settings, set **Custom domain** to `example.edu.qa` (or your domain).
- Create a `CNAME` DNS record pointing to `<your-username>.github.io`.

## Next Steps
- Add pages: create a new `.html` and add a link in the nav.
- Add subgroup pages: duplicate a card and link to a dedicated page.
- Replace the logo: put your `logo.png`/`svg` inside `assets/` and update `<img>` in the header.
- Accessibility: keep headings in order (h1 → h2 → h3), add `alt` text to images.
- Performance: compress images before adding.
